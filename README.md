# WhoIsTheSpy

See the [demo PPT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sSD9XC1xomdKb9UkjPbmRVcnnE8k3VFwI56NuG1BQYE/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed overview of the program structure.

## Rules

You will play with three bots. Everyone will be assigned a word at the beginning of the game, but one of you gets the "spy word" that is similar to but different from the word the other three players get. Each round, the three bots will throw out descriptions of their own word, and your job is to identify the "spy" within three rounds.
